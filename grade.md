Class Grade: A-

Comments: 

You've shown your base skill to be good, but you can really benefit from:

(1) checking your work to see that nothing goes wrong as opposed to checking to see if it can go right.

(2) Improved decoupling of your parts.  Your project revisions showed a lot of improvements, but still have issues such as App.js still having to know how to handle an HTTP response and login/logout not clearing the saved credentials - something that was explicitly demoed in class.  If you login, logout, and then just click login, it will use the previous credentials. 

(3) Error handling.  This is true throughout your work, not just the project.  Your project changes made a much nicer experience, but you aren't really interacting with the errors so much as assume what an error must be.

However, you made an impressive set of improvements to the project - it is much more React-based, and while it is not yet perfect your work on pulling out the authentication logic is clearly moving in the right direction.  The resulting code looks cleaner to me, hopefully you found that once you got started it was easier to work with.  I've updated your grade to account for your revisions.

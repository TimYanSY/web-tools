# Notes regarding all assignments

## No outside libraries

Unless the assignment says otherwise, do not use outside libraries to aid your work - on the job, external libraries can be a great way to avoid reinventing the wheel, but in school we need to practice your raw skills.

This includes but is not limited to:

* No jQuery
* No lodash/underscore
* No Handlebars/Moustache
* No Bootstrap
* No Foundation
* No JS frameworks (Ember, Meteor, Angular, Vue, Backbone, etc)
    * This excludes React, but only when we start using React
* No Font Awesome or similar icon libraries

## Submit your own code, not someone else's

I encourage everyone to collaborate for tips, viewpoints, and problem solving, but I want you to be the source of the code you submit.

## Be correct in the tiny details

Normally I'm not picky about typos and other common mistakes that we all make.  However, programming is a profession where tiny details matter, so I need to see that you are looking closely enough to notice these details.  Unfortunately, I cannot tell the difference between making a small mistake on a detail you know and making a mistake because you never paid attention to the detail.

So please be precise on details you asked for, such as filenames, branch names, and specific functional requirements.  If there is a doubt (and there often will be - human languages are not precise) please ask in Slack.

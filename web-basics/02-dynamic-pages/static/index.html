<h1>Dynamically Generated Pages</h1>

Ways to generate a web page:
<ul>
  <li class="done">Statically served HTML files </li>
  <li>Dynamically templated HTML files</li>
  <li class="current">Dynamically generated HTML content</li>
  <li>Dynamically generated Single Page Applications</li>
  <li>Static Single Page Applications</li>
</ul>

<p> This file (index.html) is a <i>static</i> file, as is the related CSS file it loads.  Often a server will take a request and output HTML content that didn't come from an HTML file, it is the output of a program or function, and is generally known as <i>dynamic</i> content  </p>
<p>You can see this in action at <a href="/poll">this link that isn't to a file</a></p>
